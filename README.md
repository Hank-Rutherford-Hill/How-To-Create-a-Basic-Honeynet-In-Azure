If it were not somehwat obvious to you off of the break, we are going to need to create an Azure account first.  You can do this for free (well, free for 30 days and up to $200 worth of resource credits) by [clicking here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).  By the way, when signing up for this account, you're much better off using a personal email account (an @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, etc.) rather than your school or work email.  The reason for this is that your organization may already have an Azure account.  Thus, you risk being joined into their Azure tenant where you won't have any permissions to create resources & therefore won't be able to create your honeynet!  Additionally, you're going to want to open a notepad to start storing all of your Azure credentials.  The last thing you want to do is get locked out of your account, or some of your resources.  Here's [a Chrome Extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/note-board-sticky-notes-a/goficmpcgcnombioohjcgdhbaloknabb) to my favorite notepad app.

```PLEASE use a STRONG PASSWORD for your Azure account, and enable MFA.  The virtual machines in our honeynet don't need to have a strong password (afterall, it's a honeynet), but our Azure account IS NOT part of the honeynet!  So secure your account!```
